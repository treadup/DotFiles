# This is the start of a good pylint configuration.
# Having all the default rules for pylint enabled
# generates warnings that we might not care about.
# A better approach is to test out a small subset
# of the rules by adding a small batch of rules
# to the config every two weeks or so.

# The following is a good article on this.
# https://codewithoutrules.com/2016/10/19/pylint/

# One way of generating an initial pylintrc file is
# to use the following command.
# pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
