# Mac Desktop Environment
The following applications make working with a Mac much better.

## Apptivate
Apptivate can be used to create global hotkeys that will launch or
activate an application. You can also create global hotkeys to run
scripts.

Creating keybindings for Emacs, Firefox, Chrome, Terminal and Spotify
is a good start.

## Spectacle
Spectacle is an application that provides the ability to position the
current window on the screen using a tiling approach.

Combined with the built in keybindings for switching workspaces this
give you almost everything you need when it comes to window and
workspace navigation using the keyboard.

The one thing that Spectacle is missing is the ability to send a
window from one workspace to another using the keyboard. However macOS
comes with built in support for sending a window to a different
workspace but this requires the use of the mouse. Since I hardly ever
do this I do not feel that this missing feature is enough to force me
to look for another solution.

## Alfred
Alfred is a quick launcher tool that can be used to launch
applications and find files on your mac or on the web.

You can buy a power pack for Alfred but I think it would be a better
idea to use Hammerspoon instead of the powerpack.

## Hammerspoon
Hammerspoon is an automation tool for macOS. You configure Hammerspoon
using the ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua which is an init script written in
Lua.
