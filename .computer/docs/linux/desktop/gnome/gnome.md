# Gnome
Here are some notes on the Gnome desktop environment. Gnome is the
default desktop environment for Ubuntu.

## Quarter tiling
Currently Gnome does not support quarter tiling.

There are extensions that are supposed to provide this but I do not
feel that they work very well.

Currently there is an effort to implement quarter tiling in core
Gnome. But it could be a couple of years out.

## Run or raise
Gnome does not have built in support for run or raise an application.
There is an extension that is supposed to provide this but I would
prefer this being provided by core Gnome.

## Dock
Gnome does not come with a Dock. There is an extension called Dash to Dock
that will convert the dash to a dock. There is an Ubuntu version of this
extension. So it looks like the Dash to Dock extension will be well supported
by Ubuntu going forwards.

## Conclusions
Because of the missing quarter tiling and run or raise functionality I
do not feel that Gnome as it currently stands is a good desktop
environment for me.

I might want to revisit this decision when Ubuntu 20.04 comes out.
